## Blu Age Sample Container

## Description
This pattern provides a sample container environment for running mainframe workloads which have been modernised with the AWS Blu Age tool. Blu Age converts legacy mainframe workloads into modern Java code, producing either a WAR or JAR as needed. 

This pattern provides an execution wrapper around the Java application enabling it to be executed via container orchestration services such as Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS.
